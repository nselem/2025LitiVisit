# 2025LitiVisit
Here is the code developed in my academic visit 2025 to Liti Lab.  

1. Exploring fungal diversity in shotgun and metabarcoding available datasets  
 We use the EMP project, here is the code for the metabarcoding  

2. Simulate metagenomes (short and long reads) to identify the limits of detection of Saccharomyces when combined with competitive mapping.
